To integrate with the Axelar Solana Gateway, you are not exposed to be exposed to the inner workings and security mechanisms of the Gateway. 
- For receiving GMP messages from other chains, read [Axelar Executable docs](../../crates/axelar-executable/README.md).
- For sending messages to other chains, read [Sending messages from Solana](#sending-messages-from-solana).

## Sending messages from Solana

Here you can see the full flow of how a message gets proxied through the network when sending a message from Solana to any other chain:

For a destination contract to communicate with the Axelar Solana Gateway, it must make a CPI call to the Axelar Solana Gateway.
- On Solana, there is no such concept as `msg.sender` like there is in Solidity.
- On Solana `program_id`'s **cannot** be signers.
- On Solana, only PDAs can sign on behalf of a program. The only way for programs to send messages is to create PDAs that use [`invoke_signed()`](https://docs.rs/solana-cpi/latest/solana_cpi/fn.invoke_signed.html) and sign over the CPI call.
- The interface of `axelar_solana_gateway::GatewayInstruction::CallContract` instruction defines that the first account in the `accounts[]` must be the `program_id` that is sending the GMP payload.
- The sedond account is a "siging pda" meaining that a program must generate a PDA with specific paramters and sign the CPI call for `gateway.call_contract`; The presence of such signature acts as an authorizaton token, that allows the Gateway to interpret that the provided `program_id` is indeed the one that made the call and thus will use the `program_id` as the sender.

### Axelar network steps

After the relayer sends the message to Amplifier API, that's when Axelar network and ampd perform all the validations

- Relevant ampd code is located [here, axelar-amplifier/solana/ampd](https://github.com/eigerco/axelar-amplifier/tree/solana/ampd)
- `ampd` will query the Solana RPC network for a given tx hash (in Solanas case it's actually the tx signature, which is 64 bytes)
  - retrieve the logs, parse them using [`gateway-event-stack` crate](https://github.com/eigerco/solana-axelar/tree/next/solana/crates/gateway-event-stack) to parse the logs, and then try to find an event at the given index. If the event exists and the contents match, then `ampd` will produce signatures for the rest of the Axelar network to consume


## Receiving messages on Solana

Receiving messages on Solana is a multitude more complex than sending messages. There are a couple of PDAs that are involved in the process.

### Signature verification

**Prerequisite:** initialized `Gateway Root Config PDA` with a valid verifier set; active `Multisig Prover`; acive `Relayer`;

Due to Solana limitations, we cannot verify the desired amount signatures in a single on-chain tx to fulfill the minimal requirements emposed by the Axelar protocol. For detailed reading, refer to the [axelar-solana-encoding/README.md](../crates/axelar-solana-encoding/README.md#execute-data).

The approach taken here is that:
1. Relayer receives fully merkelised data [`ExecuteData`](../crates/axelar-solana-encoding/README.md#current-limits-of-the-merkelised-implementation) from the Multisig Prover, which fulfills the following properties:
    1. we can prove that each `message` is part of the `payload digest` with the corresponding Merkle Proof
    2. we can prove that each `verifier` is part of the `verifier set` that signed the `payload digest` with the correspontind Merkle Proof
    3. each `verifier` has a corresponding Signature attached to it
2. Relayer calls `Initialize Payload Verification Session` on the Gateway [[link to processor]](https://github.com/eigerco/solana-axelar/blob/c73300dec01547634a80d85b9984348015eb9fb2/solana/programs/axelar-solana-gateway/src/processor/initialize_payload_verification_session.rs), creating a new PDA that will keep track of the verifed signatures. The `payload digest` is used as the core seed parameter for the PDA. This is safe to do because a `payload digest` will only be duplicate if the `verifier set` remains the same (this is often the case) AND all of the messages are exactly the same across batches remain the same (low chance). Even if all of the `message`s remain the same, `Axelar Solana Gateway` has idempotency on per-`message` level, meainng that duplicate execution is impossible.
3. For each `verifier` + Signature in the `ExecuteData` that signed the payload digest, the relayer sends a tx [`VerifySignature` (link to processor)](https://github.com/eigerco/solana-axelar/blob/c73300dec01547634a80d85b9984348015eb9fb2/solana/programs/axelar-solana-gateway/src/processor/verify_signature.rs). The core logic is that we:
    1. ensure that the `verifier` is part of the `verifier set` that signed the data using Merkle Proof. 
    2. check if the `signature` is valid for a given `payload diegest` and it matches the given `verifier` (by performing ecdsa recovery).
    3. update the `signature verification PDA` to track the current weight of the verifier that was verified and the index of its singature
    4. repeat this tx for every `signature` until the `quorum` has been reached

**Artifcat:** we have reached the quorum, which is tracked on `Signature Verification Session PDA`.

### Message approval

**Prerequisite:** `Signature Verification PDA` that has reached its quorum.

Same as in signatuer verification step, due to Solana limitations we cannot approve dozens of `Message`s in single tx. 

The relayer must do the following work:
1. For each GMP message in the `ExecuteData`, call [`Approve Message` (link to processor)](https://github.com/eigerco/solana-axelar/blob/c73300dec01547634a80d85b9984348015eb9fb2/solana/programs/axelar-solana-gateway/src/processor/approve_message.rs). The processor takes care of:
    1. Validating that a `message` is part of a `payload digest` using Merkle Proof.
    2. Validating that the `payload digest` corresponds to `Signtature Verification PDA`, and it has reached its quorum.
    3. Validating that the `message` has not already been initialized
    4. Initializes a new PDA (called `Incoming Message PDA`) that is responsible for `tracking approved`/`executed` state of a message. The core seed of this PDA is `command_id`. You can read more about `command_id` in the [EVM docs #replay prevention section](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-gmp-sdk-solidity/blob/main/contracts/gateway/INTEGRATION.md#replay-prevention); our implementation is exactly the same.
    5. This action emits a log for the relayer to capture.
    6. repeat this tx for every `message` in a batch.
  
**Artifcat:** For each message we have initialized a new `Incoming Message PDA` that has its state set as `approved`. For messages that had been approved in previous batches there are no changes to their PDA contents.

### Message Execution

**Prerequisite:** `Incoming Message PDA` for a message.

After the relayer reports back the event to Amplifier API about a message being approved, the relayer will receive the raw payload to call the destination program with. Because of Solana limitations, the Relayer cannot send large enough payloads in the tx arguments to satisfy the minmial requirements of Axelar protocol. Therefore the relayer does chunked uploading of the raw data to a PDA for the end-program to consume. 
Here is what the relayer needs to do with the raw payload:
1. Call [`Initialize Message Payload` (link to processor)](https://github.com/eigerco/solana-axelar/blob/c73300dec01547634a80d85b9984348015eb9fb2/solana/programs/axelar-solana-gateway/src/processor/initialize_message_payload.rs)

2. -- todo


For a third party developer to build an integrartion with the Axelar Solana Gateway and receive GMP messages, the only expectation is for the contract to implement [`axelar-executable`](../../crates/axelar-executable/README.md) interface. This allows the Relayer to have a known interfacte that it can send messages to, after they've been approved on the Gateway.

Exception of the rule is [`Interchain Token Service`](../axelar-solana-its/README.md) & [`Governance`](../axelar-solana-governance/README.md) programs, which do not implement `axelar-executable`.
