To integrate with the Axelar Solana Gateway, you are not exposed to be exposed to the inner workings and security mechanisms of the Gateway. 
- For receiving GMP messages from other chains, read [Axelar Executable docs](../../crates/axelar-executable/README.md).
- For sending messages to other chains, read [Sending messages from Solana](#sending-messages-from-solana).

## Sending messages from Solana

Here you can see the full flow of how a message gets proxied through the network when sending a message from Solana to any other chain:

For a destination contract to communicate with the Axelar Solana Gateway, it must make a CPI call to the Axelar Solana Gateway.
- On Solana, there is no such concept as `msg.sender` like there is in Solidity.
- On Solana `program_id`'s **cannot** be signers.
- On Solana, only PDAs can sign on behalf of a program. The only way for programs to send messages is to create PDAs that use [`invoke_signed()`](https://docs.rs/solana-cpi/latest/solana_cpi/fn.invoke_signed.html) and sign over the CPI call.
- The interface of `axelar_solana_gateway::GatewayInstruction::CallContract` instruction defines that the first account in the `accounts[]` must be the `program_id` that is sending the GMP payload.
- The sedond account is a "siging pda" meaining that a program must generate a PDA with specific paramters and sign the CPI call for `gateway.call_contract`; The presence of such signature acts as an authorizaton token, that allows the Gateway to interpret that the provided `program_id` is indeed the one that made the call and thus will use the `program_id` as the sender.

### Axelar network steps

After the relayer sends the message to Amplifier API, that's when Axelar network and ampd perform all the validations

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7a137e7-6545-4161-be7e-91ec9d6223a5)

- Relevant ampd code is located [here, axelar-amplifier/solana/ampd](https://github.com/eigerco/axelar-amplifier/tree/solana/ampd)
- `ampd` will query the Solana RPC network for a given tx hash (in Solanas case it's actually the tx signature, which is 64 bytes)
  - retrieve the logs, parse them using [`gateway-event-stack` crate](https://github.com/eigerco/solana-axelar/tree/next/solana/crates/gateway-event-stack) to parse the logs, and then try to find an event at the given index. If the event exists and the contents match, then `ampd` will produce signatures for the rest of the Axelar network to consume


## Receiving messages on Solana

Receiving messages on Solana is a multitude more complex than sending messages. There are a couple of PDAs that are involved in the process.

### Signature verification

**Prerequisite:** initialized `Gateway Root Config PDA` with a valid verifier set; active `Multisig Prover`; acive `Relayer`;

Due to Solana limitations, we cannot verify the desired amount signatures in a single on-chain tx to fulfill the minimal requirements emposed by the Axelar protocol. For detailed reading, refer to the [axelar-solana-encoding/README.md](../crates/axelar-solana-encoding/README.md#execute-data).

The approach taken here is that:
1. Relayer receives fully merkelised data [`ExecuteData`](../crates/axelar-solana-encoding/README.md#current-limits-of-the-merkelised-implementation) from the Multisig Prover, which fulfills the following properties:
    1. we can prove that each `message` is part of the `payload digest` with the corresponding Merkle Proof
    2. we can prove that each `verifier` is part of the `verifier set` that signed the `payload digest` with the correspontind Merkle Proof
    3. each `verifier` has a corresponding Signature attached to it
2. Relayer calls `Initialize Payload Verification Session` on the Gateway [[link to processor]](https://github.com/eigerco/solana-axelar/blob/c73300dec01547634a80d85b9984348015eb9fb2/solana/programs/axelar-solana-gateway/src/processor/initialize_payload_verification_session.rs), creating a new PDA that will keep track of the verifed signatures. The `payload digest` is used as the core seed parameter for the PDA. This is safe to do because a `payload digest` will only be duplicate if the `verifier set` remains the same (this is often the case) AND all of the messages are exactly the same across batches remain the same (low chance). Even if all of the `message`s remain the same, `Axelar Solana Gateway` has idempotency on per-`message` level, meainng that duplicate execution is impossible.
3. For each `verifier` + Signature in the `ExecuteData` that signed the payload digest, the relayer sends a tx [`VerifySignature` (link to processor)](https://github.com/eigerco/solana-axelar/blob/c73300dec01547634a80d85b9984348015eb9fb2/solana/programs/axelar-solana-gateway/src/processor/verify_signature.rs). The core logic is that we:
    1. ensure that the `verifier` is part of the `verifier set` that signed the data using Merkle Proof. 
    2. check if the `signature` is valid for a given `payload diegest` and it matches the given `verifier` (by performing ecdsa recovery).
    3. update the `signature verification PDA` to track the current weight of the verifier that was verified and the index of its singature
    4. repeat this tx for every `signature` until the `quorum` has been reached

**Artifcat:** we have reached the quorum, which is tracked on `Signature Verification Session PDA`.

### Message approval

**Prerequisite:** `Signature Verification PDA` that has reached its quorum.

Same as in signatuer verification step, due to Solana limitations we cannot approve dozens of `Message`s in single tx. 

The relayer must do the following work:
1. For each GMP message in the `ExecuteData`, call [`Approve Message` (link to processor)](https://github.com/eigerco/solana-axelar/blob/c73300dec01547634a80d85b9984348015eb9fb2/solana/programs/axelar-solana-gateway/src/processor/approve_message.rs). The processor takes care of:
    1. Validating that a `message` is part of a `payload digest` using Merkle Proof.
    2. Validating that the `payload digest` corresponds to `Signtature Verification PDA`, and it has reached its quorum.
    3. Validating that the `message` has not already been initialized
    4. Initializes a new PDA (called `Incoming Message PDA`) that is responsible for `tracking approved`/`executed` state of a message. The core seed of this PDA is `command_id`. You can read more about `command_id` in the [EVM docs #replay prevention section](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-gmp-sdk-solidity/blob/main/contracts/gateway/INTEGRATION.md#replay-prevention); our implementation is exactly the same.
    5. This action emits a log for the relayer to capture.
    6. repeat this tx for every `message` in a batch.
  
**Artifcat:** For each message we have initialized a new `Incoming Message PDA` that has its state set as `approved`. For messages that had been approved in previous batches there are no changes to their PDA contents.

### Message Execution

**Prerequisite:** `Incoming Message PDA` for a message.

After the relayer reports back the event to Amplifier API about a message being approved, the relayer will receive the raw payload to call the destination program with. Because of Solana limitations, the Relayer cannot send large enough payloads in the tx arguments to satisfy the minmial requirements of Axelar protocol. Therefore the relayer does chunked uploading of the raw data to a PDA for the end-program to consume. 
Here is what the relayer needs to do with the raw payload:
1. Call [`Initialize Message Payload` (link to processor)](https://github.com/eigerco/solana-axelar/blob/c73300dec01547634a80d85b9984348015eb9fb2/solana/programs/axelar-solana-gateway/src/processor/initialize_message_payload.rs). The seed of the PDA is directly tied to the relayer and to the `Incoming Message PDA` (`command_id`). This means that if there are multiple concurrent relayers, they will not be overriding each others' payload data. 
2. Chunk the raw payload and upload it in batches (each separate tx) using [`Write Message Payload`](https://github.com/eigerco/solana-axelar/blob/main/solana/programs/axelar-solana-gateway/src/processor/write_message_payload.rs). Such an approach allows us to upload up to 10kb of raw message data. That is the upper bound of the Solana integration.
3. After the payload has been fully uploaded, the relayer must call [`Commit Message Payload`](https://github.com/eigerco/solana-axelar/blob/033bd17df32920eb6b57a0e6b8d3f82298b0c5ff/solana/programs/axelar-solana-gateway/src/processor/commit_message_payload.rs) which will compute the hash of the raw payload. This also ensures that after the hash has been computed & commited, the payload cannot be mutated in-place by the relayer anymore.

    As a result we now have the following PDAs:
    - `Incoming Message PDA`: contains execution status of a message (will be `approved` sate after messages approval). Relationship - 1 PDA for each unique message on the Axelar network.
    - `Message Payload PDA`: contains the raw payload of a message. There can be many `Message Payload PDA`s, one for each operation relayer. Each `Message Payload PDA` points to a specific `Incoming Message PDA`.
  
Next, the relayer must commuincate with the destination program. For a third party developer to build an integrartion with the `Axelar Solana Gateway` and receive GMP messages, the only expectation is for the contract to implement [`axelar-executable`](../../crates/axelar-executable/README.md) interface. This allows the Relayer to have a known interfacte for which it can compose and send transaction to, after they've been approved on the Gateway. Exception of the rule is [`Interchain Token Service`](../axelar-solana-its/README.md) & [`Governance`](../axelar-solana-governance/README.md) programs, which do not implement `axelar-executable`.

Relayer calls the `destination program`:
1. The `destination program` (via `axelar-executale`) must call [`Validate Message`](https://github.com/eigerco/solana-axelar/blob/033bd17df32920eb6b57a0e6b8d3f82298b0c5ff/solana/programs/axelar-solana-gateway/src/processor/validate_message.rs).
    1. The `destination program` needs to craft a `signing pda` which acts as ensurance that the given `program id` is indeed the desired recipient of the message (akin to `msg.sender` on Solidity). 
    2. `Incoming Message PDA` status gets set to `executed`
    3. event gets emitted
2. After message execution, the relayer can close `Message Payload PDA` using [`Close Message Payload`](https://github.com/eigerco/solana-axelar/blob/033bd17df32920eb6b57a0e6b8d3f82298b0c5ff/solana/programs/axelar-solana-gateway/src/processor/close_message_payload.rs) call. This will return the ~99% of the funds that were spent on uploading the raw data on-chain.

**Artifact:** Message has been succesfully executed; `Incoming Message PDA` has been marked as `executed`; `Message Payload PDA` has been closed and funds refunded to the Relayer.

### Verifier rotation

**Prerequisite:** `Signature Verification PDA` that has reached its quorum.

After the signatures have been verified:
1. The Relayer will submit a tx [`Rotate Signers`](https://github.com/eigerco/solana-axelar/blob/033bd17df32920eb6b57a0e6b8d3f82298b0c5ff/solana/programs/axelar-solana-gateway/src/processor/rotate_signers.rs).
    1. The processor will validate the following logic:
        - If the tx was **not** submitted by `operator`, then check if signer rotation is not happening too frequently (the `rotation delay` parameter is configured on the `Gateway Config PDA`)
        - If the tx was submitted by the `operator`, then skip the rotation delay check 
    3. Check: Only roate the verifiers if the `verifier set` that signed the action is the **latest** `verifier set`
    4. Check: ensure that the new verifier set is not duplicate of an old one
    5. Initialize a new `Verifier Tracker PDA` that will track the epoch and the hash of the newly created verifier set
    6. Update the `Gateway Config PDA` to update the latest verifier set epoch
    7. This will emit an event for the relayer to capture and report back to ampd


## Operator role

This is a role that is able to roate the verifier set without enforcing the `minimum rotation delay`.

The role can be updated using [`Transfer Operatorship`](https://github.com/eigerco/solana-axelar/blob/033bd17df32920eb6b57a0e6b8d3f82298b0c5ff/solana/programs/axelar-solana-gateway/src/processor/transfer_operatorship.rs#L33). The ix is accessible to:
- **The old operator** can transfer operatorship to a new user
- The **`bpf_loader_upgadeable::upgrade_authority`** can also transfer operatorship. This is equivalent to the upgrade authority on the Solidity implementation

## Differences from the EVM implementation

| Action | EVM reference impl | Solana implementation | Reasoning |
| - | - | - | - |
| [Authentication](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-gmp-sdk-solidity/blob/main/contracts/gateway/INTEGRATION.md#authentication) | Every verifier and all the message get hashed together in a single hash, then signatures get verified against that hash. All done in a single tx. | Every action is done in a separate tx. Signatures get verified against a hash first. Then we use Merkle Proofs to prove that a message is part of the hash. | Solana cannot do that many actions in a single transaction, we need to split up the approval process in many small txs. This is described in detail on [axelar-solana-encoding](../crates/axelar-solana-encoding/README.md#current-limits-of-the-merkelised-implementation) crate |
| Receiving the message on the destination contract | Payload is passed as tx args. | Payload is chunked and uploaded to on-chain storage in many small txs | Otherwise the avg payload size we could provide would be ~600-800 bytes; Solana tx size is limited to 1232 bytes and a lot of that is consumed by metadata | 
| [Message size](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-gmp-sdk-solidity/blob/main/contracts/gateway/INTEGRATION.md#limits) | 16kb is min; more than 1mb on EVM | 10kb is max with options to increase this in the future | The maximum amount of PDA storage (on-chain contract owned account) is 10kb when initialized up-front |
| Updating verifier set | Requires the whole verifier set to be present, then it is re-hashed and then re-validated on chain | Only the verifier set hash is provided in tx parameters, we don't re-hash individual entries from the verifier set upon verifier set rotation. We take the verifier set hash from the Multisig Prover as granted, expect is as always being valid. | We cannot hash that many entries (67 verifiers being the minimum requirement) in a single tx anyway. The only thing we can do is _"prove that a verifier belongs to the verifier set"_ but even that would not change the underlying verifier set hash that we set. |
| [Upgradability](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-gmp-sdk-solidity/blob/main/contracts/gateway/INTEGRATION.md#upgradability) | Gateway is deployed via a proxy contract | Gateway is deployed using `bpf_loader_upgradeable` program | This is the standard on Solana |
